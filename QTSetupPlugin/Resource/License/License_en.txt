Yuzhang old county, Hongdu new house. The stars are divided into wings, and the ground is connected to Henglu. Lapel three rivers and lead five lakes, control the barbarians and lead Ouyue. Wuhua Tianbao, the ruins of Longguang She Niudou; outstanding people, Xu Ru under Chen Fan's couch. Xiongzhou fog column, handsome star gallop. Taihuang was at the turn of Yixia, and the host and guests enjoyed the beauty of the southeast. The governor of Yan Gongzhi Yawang, the halberd is coming; Yifan, the Yuwen Xinzhou, is temporarily stationed. Ten days of vacation, there are like clouds of winning friends; Teng Jiao Qi Feng, Meng Xueshi's Ci Zong; Zidian Qingshuang, General Wang's arsenal. The lord of the family is the slaughter, and the road is famous in the area; how does the boy know, the bow meets the victory.

When the dimension is September, the sequence belongs to the three autumns. The stagnant water is exhausted and the cold pool is clear, the smoke and light are condensed and the twilight mountains are purple. Just like on the road, visit the scenery in Chong'a; Lin Dizi's Changzhou, the old mansion of heaven and man. The mountains are towering green, and the sky is high; the flying pavilion is flowing, and there is no land below. Heting Fuzhu, the lingering of the poor island; Guidianlan Palace, that is, the body of Gangluan.

Wearing embroidered darts, looking down on carved scorpions, the mountains and plains are wide-eyed, and Chuanze is horrified. Lu Yan is on the ground, the home of Zhongming and Dingshi; Clouds are sold out in the rain, and the color is bright in the district. The sunset and the solitary bird fly together, and the autumn waters are the same color as the sky. Fishing boats sing late, ringing the shore of the poor Pengli; the geese array is frightened by the cold, and the sound breaks the Hengyang River.

The distant lapel is smooth, and Yixing is flying. The cool sound is made and the breeze is fresh, the fine song is condensed and the white clouds are restrained. The green bamboos in Suiyuan are refreshing the bottles of Pengze; Four beautiful tools, two difficulties. The poor look at Zhongtian, and the extreme entertainment travels in the free days. The sky is high and the earth is different, and the universe is infinite; when happiness is exhausted and sorrow comes, there are a number of emptiness and emptiness. Look at Chang'an under the sun, and see Wu meeting in the clouds. The terrain is extremely deep and Nanming is deep, Tianzhu is high and Beichen is far away. Guanshan is difficult to overcome, who grieves for those who have lost their way? When we meet by chance, we are all guests from other places. When Emperor Huai disappeared, what year was the Fengxuan family?

Ouch! Bad luck, bad luck. Feng Tang is easy to be old, and Li Guang is difficult to seal. When Qu Jiayi was in Changsha, there was no holy master; when Liang Hong was in Haiqu, was there a lack of clarity? The gentleman you rely on sees the opportunity, and the master knows his fate. When you are old, you are stronger, would you rather shift the heart of a white head? Poor and strong, do not fall into the blue sky. Judging from the greedy springs, you will feel refreshed, and you will still be happy when you are dry. Although the North Sea is on credit, it can be picked up quickly; the east corner has passed away, and Sangyu is not too late. Mengchang is noble and pure, and serves the country in his spare time; Ruan Ji is arrogant, and it is useless to cry in desperation!

Bo, Sanchi Weiming, a scholar. There is no way to invite Ying, waiting for the weak crown of the final army; there is a Huai throwing a pen, Mu Zong's long wind. Leave the hairpin and wat in Bailing, and in the morning and evening in Wanli. Not the treasure tree of the Xie family, but the neighbor of the Meng family. He is becoming more and more courteous, and he will accompany the carp pair; today, I will hold my robe, and I like to support the Dragon Gate. Yang Yi did not meet, so he touched Lingyun and felt sorry for himself; since Zhong Qi met, why should he be ashamed to play Liu Shui?

Woohoo! The resort is not very frequent, and the feast is hard to come again; the Lanting Pavilion is gone, Zizeqiu Ruins. The parting words, I am fortunate to be grateful to the great condolences; to climb high to make a blessing is to look forward to Qun Gong. Dare to exhaust the contempt, respectful, sparse and short quotations; every word is composed, and the four rhymes are complete. Please sprinkle the Pan River, and each one will dump the land and Haiyuner:

King Teng's high pavilion is near Jiangzhu, and Peiyu Mingluan stops singing and dancing.

The painting towers fly towards the clouds in Nanpu, and the bead curtain rolls over the mountains and rains in the evening.

Xianyuntan has a long shadow day, and things change and stars move several times in autumn.

Where is the emperor in the pavilion now? Outside the threshold, the Yangtze River flows freely.
